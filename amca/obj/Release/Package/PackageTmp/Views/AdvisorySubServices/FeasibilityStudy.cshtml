                    <h3><strong>Understanding the Goals of the Feasibility Study</strong></h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Legal Feasibility</strong><br />Performing investigations with the proposed projects, the legal feasibility focuses on all the legal aspects of the project. It gives appropriate findings on whether the project has made good decisions in all facets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Feasibility</strong><br />Serving as the independent project assessment, the economic feasibility boosts the so-called “credibility of the project” by characterizing its viability and cost and focusing on the benefits associated with a project before the financial resources are allocated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Feasibility</strong><br />Focusing on the technical resources in the organization, technical feasibility helps determine whether the organization has been able to fulfill the guidelines in converting the ideas into working systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operational Feasibility</strong><br />Aiming to determine whether the project plan fulfills the analysis phase’s prerequisites, the operational feasibility emphasizes how well the project's necessities can be met by completing it. </li>
                        <li><strong>Scheduling Feasibility</strong><br />The scheduling feasibility will estimate the number of times needed to complete the project.</li>
                    </ol>
