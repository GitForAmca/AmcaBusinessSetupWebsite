                        Management consulting is the practice of assisting associations to improve their performance. Associations may draw upon the services of management consultants for different reasons, including gaining external advice and access to consultants' specialized aptitude. As a result of their exposure to, and relationships with various organizations, consulting firms are typically aware of industry "best practices." However, the circumstances under consideration may limit the ability or appropriateness of transferring such practices from one organization to another. Because of the great diversity in disciplines and contrasts in required capacities of advisors, management consulting is the broadest area within the consulting industry. It covers 50% - 55% of the total consulting market.
