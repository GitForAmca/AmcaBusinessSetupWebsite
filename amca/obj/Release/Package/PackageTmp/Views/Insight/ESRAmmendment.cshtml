                            <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
                            <p>The Economic Substance Regulations, which is also known as “ESR” was formally introduced to the United Arab Emirates through Cabinet of Minister Resolution No. (31) of 2019, on 30th of April 2019.  The aforementioned regulation aims to combat harmful tax practices while complying with the global standards. Similarly, the Ministry of Finance introduced the so-called “Relevant Activities” which plays a vital function in complying with the Economic Substance Regulation. </p>

                            <h2><strong>What do you mean by Relevent Activities?</strong></h2>
                            <p>Entities carrying out Relevant Activities shall demonstrate their Economic Substance here in the UAE and comply with the submission of the notification and Economic Substance Report to their Regulatory Authorities. The Relevant Activities are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Banking Business</li>
                                <li>Insurance Business</li>
                                <li>Fund Management Business</li>
                                <li>Financial or Leasing Business</li>

                                <li>Distribution and Services Business</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2><strong>ESR UAE: Amended</strong></h2>
                            <p>A revised legislation overhauling the ESR has been issued by the UAE this 2020. The amendment in the ESR UAE was formally introduced through Cabinet of Minister Resolution No. (57) of 2020 on 10th of August 2020. The ESR guidelines was similarly updated through Ministerial Decision No. (100) of 2020 on 19th of August 2020. </p>
                            <p><strong>Changes in the Amended ESR:</strong></p>
                            <p>The Amended ESR points out the following changes: </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The Definition of Licensee:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The amended ESR clearly states the new classification of Licensee which includes (a) a juridical person (incorporated inside or outside the State) or (b) an unincorporated partnership; UAE registered, which includes a Free Zone and a Financial Free Zone and carries on a Relevant Activity.</li>
                                        <li>A parent company which is registered in the UAE shall file all their Relevant Activities as well as the Relevant Activities conducted by their UAE branches. For this reason, UAE branches will be no longer a “Licensee” as they will be already an extension of their parent company. </li>
                                        <li>A UAE branch of a foreign company shall file their own ESR (if they carry out a Relevant Activity) unless the Relevant Income of the UAE branch is subject to tax in the foreign company’s authority. </li>
                                        <li>A parent company in the UAE shall not consolidate the activities and income of the foreign branch for purposes of the Regulations, provided the Relevant Income of the foreign branch is subject to tax in the jurisdiction where the branch is located.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Exempted Licensee:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Entities that are tax resident in jurisdiction outside the UAE</li>
                                        <li><strong>Investment Funds</strong></li>
                                        <li>Entities that are wholly owned by UAE residents, likewise not part of a multinational group and only carry out business activities in the UAE</li>
                                        <li>UAE branches of a foreign head office / parent which relevant income is subject to tax in the foreign head office / parent jurisdiction.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <p>An entity which will fall under Exempted Licensee is still eligible in submitting the ESR Notification, providing with sufficient evidence of becoming an Exempted Licensee. </p>
