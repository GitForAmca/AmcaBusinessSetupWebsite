                            <p>The Ministry of Economy (MoE) revealed the extension of the deadline allowed to Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) to register in the systems approved for countering money laundering and battling the financing of terrorism, until April 30, 2021.</p>

                            <p>The extension has been granted because of a large number of organizations in the sector seeking to register in the last days of the previous deadline, which expired on March 31, 2021.  Moreover, considering the conditions of companies and the business sector in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic has also been taken into consideration.</p>

                            <h2><strong>What is goAML?</strong></h2>
                            <p><strong>'goAML'</strong>, is a anti money laundering reporting platform created by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to control organized crimes. Every financial entities and Designated Non-Financial Businesses or Professions need to register on ‘goAML’. The platform will comfort the Financial Intelligence Unit of UAE to hinder money laundering, financing of terrorism and other unlawful financial activities</p>

                            <h2><strong>Why register on goAML</strong></h2>

                            <p><strong>Before the goAML registration you need to realize that there are two registration stages.</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The registration stage in the protection system (SACM) of goAML portal.</li>
                                <li>The registration stage in the goAML system.</li>
                            </ol>
