                    <h2><strong>What is due diligence in business?</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                        Due diligence is the systematic examination of a business before an event like a merger or acquisition, IPO, capital raise, or audit. The investigation is carried out to assess commercial and legal risks and opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong>What does the due diligence process involve?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Due diligence is an extensive process that covers numerous aspects of a business, from financial statements and accounting records to key staff members and agreements. The elements of an organization covered by due diligence usually fall within five broad areas: commercial performance, finances, legal compliance, operations, and environmental impact.</p>
                    <p>As there are no official guidelines for what should be covered by the due diligence process, it is generally tailored to each specific transaction. Some types of due diligence are more significant in particular industries than in others, and the depth, length, and scope of the investigation usually depend on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The nature of the transaction</li>
                        <li>The purchasing or investing company’s needs and interests</li>
                        <li>The perceived level of risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3><strong>How the Due Diligence Process Works</strong></h3>
                    <p>The due diligence process requires the involvement of both the purchaser or investor and their accountant and attorney. However, it's generally performed after an intent-to-purchase agreement has been signed before a formal purchase agreement with the exchange of assets and funds is entered into. The letter of intent is a non-binding document that each party signs to allow the due diligence process to start.</p>
                    <p>As due diligence starts, it's time to get external advisors involved. For example, you may want to hire a business appraiser to look through all business records to give you an estimate of the business value, an attorney to look at legal matters, and a CPA to review accounting records.</p>
