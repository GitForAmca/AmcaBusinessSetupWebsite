                    <p>A company formation in the UAE indisputably offers good privileges to its investors. From having a conducive working environment to easy accessibility and safety and security, Dubai is the best option for company formation.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the Mainland Company Formation and the Free Zone Company Formation, the Offshore Companies are similarly registered business entities with non-resident status and are administered by the Offshore Company regulations and trade rules in the UAE. Amongst the benefits of having an Offshore Company is the capability of the foreign investors to grow their businesses internationally, which is outside the UAE’s jurisdiction. The UAE Offshore companies can manage, control and oversee companies and their properties globally.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Advantages of Offshore Company Formation</strong></h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Full Foreign Ownership</strong><br />This type of company formation does not require a local shareholder, which means that the foreign investors own the 100% share equity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Corporate Taxes Exemption</strong><br />There is no personal tax or corporation tax imposed on offshore companies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Apt Registration Processes</strong><br />From the beginning until the end, the offshore company formation process is considered simple and does not pose apparent difficulties for foreign investors. Upon completing all the required documents, the registration can be completed within 3 to 4 working days only.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cheap Operational Costs</strong><br />The Offshore companies are not entitled to perform any registration for leasing purposes and other related activities. However, offshore companies can run the business through the office of registered agents.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Requirement for the Share Capital</strong><br />The Registrar may require the company to pay their capital as adequate as the level of their proposed activities, but it has no requirements for any minimum share capital.</li>
                        <li><strong>Convenience in the Transferable Shares</strong><br />It is more convenient for offshore companies to perform the transferable shares.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy</strong><br />The offshore companies can fully be benefited from the privilege of having privacy.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>These are some benefits that foreign investors may acquire from having offshore companies. One of the advantages of having lawsuit protection is that the assets are completely protected by legal means. The registered agent can fulfill all the official requirements on behalf of the investors.</p>
