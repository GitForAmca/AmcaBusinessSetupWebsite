            <p>AMCA was established in 2010, primarily as an auditing firm. Our commitment to excellence & in-depth knowledge of the business has assisted us in establishing ourselves as a pioneer in the field. We have served many organizations in public and private sectors in our decade-long presence. Having started our operations in Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai, we gradually expanded into two additional locations; one in Abu Dhabi and the other in JLT DMCC in Dubai. In addition to this, AMCA is a tax agency licensed by the Federal Tax Authority.</p>
            <p>Through the years, we have offered a wide range of services, including Auditing & Assurance, Bookkeeping & Accounting, Advisory Services, Business Setup & Liquidation. In addition, our services have recently been expanded to include Data Analysis and IT Solutions. </p>
