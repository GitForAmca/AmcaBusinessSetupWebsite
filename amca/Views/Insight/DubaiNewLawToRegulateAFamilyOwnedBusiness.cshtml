                            <p><strong>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai issued a new law to regulate family-owned businesses in Dubai.</strong></p>

                            <p>Due to the astounding infrastructure, geologically favorable circumstances, and gifted human resources, organizing a <strong>business here in Dubai</strong> is one of the best decisions to consider. Dubai is known to be one of the <strong>fastest-growing economy</strong> that could help you with your business to grow as well. Be that as it may, much the same as some other places, maintaining a business here in Dubai is not as simple as it appears. There are a lot of things to be considered in maintaining a business in Dubai. </p>

                            <p>Does your family have a business here in Dubai? Or, on the other hand, is your family intending to begin a business here in Dubai?? Here are the things that you must need to consider in running your <strong>family-owned business in the UAE.</strong> </p>

                            <h2><strong>Family Businesses in Dubai</strong></h2>

                            <p>DUBAI - Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai issued <strong>a new law to regulate family-owned business</strong>. With a clear legal structure for family ownership, the law assists with securing the family’s wealth, and enhance the family business’ contribution to economic and social development.</p>

                            <p>In order for the <strong>family ownership contract</strong> to become legally binding, the following should be strictly monitored: (1) All parties of contract must be members of the same family and should have a single common interest; (2) The share of each member should be clearly stated in the contract; (3) The parties of the contract should own all the legal rights of the monies and assets that are under the domain of contract.</p>


                            <p>In addition to that, this law additionally directs the articles of the <strong>family ownership contract,</strong> the business’ structure and management, the formation of the board, the authorities, and obligations appointed to the board and the executives just as the administration's capacity and constraint</p>

                            <p>The recently issued <strong>Law No. (9) 2020,</strong> states that the validity of a family contract can extend up to 15 years and it can be renewed for a similar term if all the concerned parties consented to do as such. </p>

                            <p>
                                Also, it is clearly mandated that the contract must be appropriately authenticated by the notary public as per the rules and regulations specified in
                                <strong>Law No. 4 of 2013</strong> regarding Notaries Public in the Emirate of Dubai.
                            </p>

                            <p>The law characterizes the duties and specialists of government substances as respects to encourage the development of family-owned businesses</p>

                            <p>Be that as it may, this law is alternatively applicable just to existing and new family ownership including equity securities and proprietorship. Family ownership in public joint-stock companies, movable and immovable properties are not included from this law. </p>

                            <h2><strong>Company Formation in Dubai</strong></h2>
