                            <p>The <strong>meaning of auditing</strong> has changed a lot since then until now. If there is what is called the evolution of humans, there is likewise the <strong>evolution of auditing.</strong></p>
                            <p>Unlike the definition and the process of auditing nowadays, it existed primarily as a method to maintain governmental accountancy, and record-keeping. According to some studies, during the times of Ancient Egyptians, Greek and Romans, auditing the accounts of public institutions transpired.</p>
                            <p><strong>Auditing clerks</strong> who are characterized as the checkers of figures, postings, and documents to ensure that they are mathematically accurate and properly coded were overwhelmingly named in those days concentrating working on the public accounts, to trace frauds, and keep an eye on whether the receipts and payments are being recorded as it ought to be by the concerned person. Basically, these responsibilities were the primary objective of auditing during those days. </p>
                            <p>In the <strong>mid-twentieth century</strong>, the expansion sought after for auditors prompt the improvement of the testing procedure. Auditors built up an approach to deliberately choose key cases as illustrative of the organization's general performance.</p>
                            <p>The audit has been dynamically developing from that point forward; the advancement is as fast as the changing of the PC age. The examination of information has risen, and CPA's jobs will keep on being a vital job in that procedure. <strong>Automation and the digitization of a business data</strong> are currently reshaping the account work, changing the way we, our customers and our bosses approach our work. </p>

                            <p>Be that as it may, in spite of the fact that the utilization of advancements and automation will increase in the up and coming days, <strong>judgment and decision-making cannot be automated.</strong> No innovation can ever supplant the novel duties of the genuine auditors. </p>
